the lower bound of comparison sort is nlg(n), so no algorithm based on comparison could be faster.

the running time of counting sort is: (k+n). k means the max value of the array

running time of radix sort: (d*(n+k))
d: the digits 
n: the possibles value for every digit (e.g. from 0 to 9)
the sort method of each digit must be stable

bucket sort: running time is (n)
