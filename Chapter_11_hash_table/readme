similar to array but more flexible

collision resolution by chaining:
all elements that are in collision will be stored in a lists. 
worst case: if all elements are in collision, to search specifil element o(n) time will be needed.
average case: time for searching an element equals o(1+a)  (a: load factor)
in average case, if the number of slots is proportional to the number of the elements, n=o(m). a=o(1), so the searching time will be o(n)

hash function:
division, multiplication, universal hashing.

open addressing:
load factor <= 1
one element in one slot, no lists necessary
3 different probing method
the successful/unsuccessful probing number depends on the load factor
