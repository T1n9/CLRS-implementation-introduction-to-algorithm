worst case for search: o(n). just like a list if the tree is very unbalanced
best case: lg(n). 

average case is more close to the best case

search, minimun, successor, predecessor, insert and delete have the running time o(h).
h: height of the tree

to insert/delete we have to traverse the tree and edit the the node and node pointer, then we should traverse the tree with node** 
(the pointer of the node pointer).
it is also possible to do that in anothe way, that is traverse the tree recursively.
