Some problems have very inefficient running time if solved in a regular way. They might have exponential running time, which should
be avoided at all cost.
In dynamic programming the result of the solved problems will be saved, so in further calculation these results will be directly read
but not calculated again. This is called time-memory trade off. We use some extra space and try to save time from it. This trade off
can reduce the running time from exponential to polynomial, which is very benificial for us.
