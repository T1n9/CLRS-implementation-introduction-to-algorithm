the running time of heap sort is nlg(n)

in-place algorithm: you only need fixed size of extra storage besides the input and output array for the sorting

in most cases it depend on the implementation. For example, merge sort is considered as non-in-place sort, but a implementation of
merg-sort as in-place is also possible.
